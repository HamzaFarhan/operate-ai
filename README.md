# Operate AI MVP - CFO in a Box

## Architecture Evolution

### Approach 1: Initial Brainstorming - Polars Functions Approach
Initially, we considered creating a comprehensive library of Polars functions for common Excel and financial operations. This approach would have provided:
- Direct Python-based financial calculations
- Excel-like function interfaces
- Type-safe data transformations

**Challenge Discovered:** This approach led to approximately 200 possible tools, creating an overwhelming and unwieldy system that would be difficult to maintain and use effectively.

### Approach 2: Pivot to DuckDB + SQL
We decided to go with SQL and leverage DuckDB's powerful SQL engine for financial analysis:
- **DuckDB Advantages:** Columnar storage, advanced analytics functions, native CSV integration
- **SQL Familiarity:** Leverages existing SQL knowledge for financial calculations
- **Performance:** Memory-optimized processing for large datasets
- **Flexibility:** Dynamic query generation vs. fixed function library

### Approach 3: Graph-Based SQL Architecture (cfo_graph.py)
We implemented the SQL approach using a complex graph-based workflow system:
- **Pydantic Graph:** State machine for agent interactions with SQL execution
- **Multiple Node Types:** RunSQLNode, WriteSheetNode, UserInteractionNode, TaskResultNode
- **Complex State Management:** GraphState with message history and attempt tracking
- **SQL Integration:** Graph nodes executing DuckDB queries

**Challenge Discovered:** The graph architecture was unnecessarily complex for our use case, adding overhead without significant benefits for the financial analysis workflows we needed to support.

### Approach 4: Simplified SQL Agent Architecture (finn.py)
We simplified to a clean agent-based architecture while keeping the SQL approach:
- **Single Agent:** Streamlined interaction model with direct SQL execution
- **DuckDB Integration:** Direct SQL queries without graph complexity
- **Planning Integration:** Systematic planning and execution tracking
- **Memory Integration:** Persistent learning across sessions

**Challenge Discovered:** Even with the simplified architecture, letting the agent create SQL queries of any complexity made it prone to mistakes and hard to debug. The agent would often perform multiple analytical steps in a single complex query, making it difficult to identify what went wrong and provide targeted corrections when errors occurred.
