# Customer LTV & CAC Analysis (Jan 2023 - Dec 2023)

## Assumptions, Issues, and Solutions

**Assumptions:**
- Customer cohort is defined as all customers with an active subscription as of Jan 1, 2023 (regardless of when they first joined).
- Each customer's initial subscription and plan type is determined by their earliest subscription record (per requirements).
- Churned customers are those whose latest subscription ended between Jan 1, 2023 and Dec 31, 2023.
- If a segment has 0% churn, a 5-year customer lifetime (20% annual churn) is assumed for LTV calculation.
- Profit margin is set at 75% (SaaS industry standard).
- CAC by channel uses provided industry estimates, as no direct CAC data was available.
- All monetary values are rounded to 2 decimals, percentages to 4 decimals.
- Only segments with nonzero customer counts are shown.

**Issues Encountered & Solutions:**
- Some segments (e.g., certain plans or industries) may have very small sample sizes; results for these should be interpreted with caution.
- No direct CAC data by plan or channel; used provided industry benchmarks.
- Some parallel SQL runs did not save files; reran queries sequentially to ensure all outputs were captured.
- Some segments (e.g., Pro plan) may not appear in the preview due to zero customers in the cohort for that segment.

- The Enterprise plan and Education industry segments have the highest LTVs, but sample sizes are small.
- Paid Search and Email channels deliver the highest LTV/CAC ratios.
- Churn rates are highest for Affiliate and Email channels; consider retention initiatives for these segments.
