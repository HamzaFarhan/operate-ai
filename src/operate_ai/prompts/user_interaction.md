# User Interaction Instructions

Use the `UserInteraction` tool to interact with the user. Could be for asking a question, to give a progress update, to validate assumptions, or anything else needed to proceed.
If asking for something like a formula or what value to use, etc, include a suggestion or whatever you think is the best course of action.
